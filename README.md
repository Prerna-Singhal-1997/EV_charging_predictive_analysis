# Predictive Charging Assistance for EV Stations

## Project Overview
Electric vehicles (EVs) are becoming increasingly popular, but public charging infrastructure is not keeping up. This project aims to support businesses in installing and managing EV chargers by predicting charging durations and analyzing user demand patterns.

## Business Opportunity
Businesses can sell charging session minutes to customers and offer value-added experiences during the charging time, creating new revenue streams and improving customer engagement.

## Key Features
- **Charge Time Prediction:** Accurately forecasts the duration of EV charging sessions to help optimize station recommendations and resource allocation.
- **Demand Pattern Analysis:** Analyzes user demand to reduce wait times and prevent congestion.
- **Dynamic Pricing Strategies:** Recommends adjusting prices during peak and off-peak hours to balance demand and maximize revenue.
- **Energy Management:** Balances energy distribution across multiple chargers to reduce operational costs and avoid grid strain.
- **Proactive Maintenance:** Identifies underperforming chargers and schedules repairs to minimize downtime and enhance reliability.

## Dataset
This project uses a dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/valakhorasani/electric-vehicle-charging-patterns/data).

## Impact
By leveraging predictive analytics, this model empowers businesses to improve customer satisfaction, optimize station efficiency, and increase profitability with real-time actionable insights.
